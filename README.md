# MERN Twitter Clone
### What is this?
This project is a twitter clone created with the MERN stack. It is a small project I am making to get more familiar with these technologies and methodologies.

### Goals:
- Create front-end components with React that allows users to submit 'chirps' and leave comments/likes.
- Utilize Express to handle routes and passing information.
- Create User/Chirps Schemas through form submissions.
- Create working validation for users utilizing Passport.
- Save Users data to a MongoDB cluster and fetch it to display on the front-end.
- Create a "Guest" account for new visitors to login and 'try out' the service.
